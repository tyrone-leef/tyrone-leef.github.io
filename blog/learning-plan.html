      <h2>My long-term goal and career pathway</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal would be to become proficient using the technologies and software skills that I learn at Dev Academy. 
        An Ideal career pathway for me would be to start with an internship and then to secure a permanent full-time position within web development.
      </p>

      <h2>My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      <p>
        I think my research skills are a valuable strength to have because this experience often requires a lot of self-learning. 
        I have some prior learning experience in software development so I think that contributes to my ability to do efficient research. 
        I have implemented the growth mindset which I think will help with my development in skills and talents as I like to challenge myself to learn more through hard work and dedication. 
        As for limitations I'd say poor time management would be one as sometimes I get so caught up in one thing and forget I should be spending time in 
        something else I should be doing. Another would be procrastination which usually happens when I have to do something I dislike. Luckily, 
        I have been enjoying myself so far but I plan to overcome this limitation.
      </p>

    <h2>Skills I would like to see developed while at Dev Academy</h2>
    <p>
      I would like to develop my communication skills as I want to become more effective at conveying my thoughts and ideas. 
      I hope to also improve my creativity, as I feel like I could definitely think more outside the box. I plan to improve on this by exploring multiple solutions of 
      creativity and doing experiments of my own.

    <h2>How I will manage my workload in this programme</h2>

    <h3>How I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
    <p>I will manage my productivity by setting goals each day as to what tasks I should complete and making sure I finish them before the end of the day. 
      Reflection is a big part of this programme I found that it helps to understand and gain insight in the learning material. 
      I will also do some reflection of my own so that I can remember the key concepts and to identify ways to improve. 
      I plan to improve my productivity by eliminating distractions such as not having my phone nearby and listening to brown noise when it gets a little noisy. I'm also using a separate account for this programme 
      so that I don't get tempted to slack off.
    </p>

    <h3>What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me</h3>
    <p>
      If things are starting to get tough then the first thing I would do is to see if I can re-evaluate my goals for the day so that I can maybe work on something easier 
      before getting back to those more difficult goals. Breaking up the large tasks into smaller ones can also help with achieving the goals I set.  
      Taking a break is an important part of remaining productive to relieve stress and gather my thoughts. I notice that it can also lead to solutions as I find myself often coming up with ideas when 
      I'm lying in bed or when I'm in the middle of doing something else.
    </p>

    <h3>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
      I usually look to online research when I'm stuck but if I cannot find the answer that I am looking for within a reasonable amount of time then 
      I will seek guidance from the facilitators or peers in the discord channel.
    </p>

    <h3>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      A positive learning environment is important for everyone taking part because it has an impact on our engagement which I think is crucial for our learning experience.
      The main thing I expect is a response within a timely manner to clarify any questions that may be asked and clear explanations on the learning material.
