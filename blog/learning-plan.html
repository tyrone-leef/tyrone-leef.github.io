        <h2>My long term goal</h2>
        <p>
          I hope to use the skills that I gain during this course to further increase my knowledge in web-development and to put those skills to use in the field of programming. 
          The impact that I would like to make once I leave Dev Academy is to be known as just someone who gets stuff done and can be relied on.
        </p>

        <h2>My biggest strengths and limitations in Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          One of my biggest strengths in Bootcamp will be my attention to detail. 
          Throughout foundations I noticed that I have gotten better at recognising errors in my code, remembering commands, and noticing patterns. 
          Another strength I have will be my patience and I think this will help when it comes to encountering tough challenges as finding solutions can require a bit of time and focus.
          In foundations I listed procrastination as one of my limitations, but I don't think procrastinating is an option at Bootcamp so I think my next biggest limitation would be my communication skills. 
          I need to improve on my communication skills because in order to become more cooperative I need to make an effort in communicating clearly with others.
        </p>

        <h2>My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          Speaking in front of groups is definitely one of the biggest challenges for me as I don't have much practice speaking to an audience. 
          I aim to bring a positive attitude and I will try to be aware of how I speak to others.
        </p>

        <h2>Non-technical skills I would like to see developed while at Dev Academy</h2>
        <p>
          A non-technical skill that I would like to see developed while at Dev Academy would be my ability to give feedback as sometimes, I just don't know how. I need to work on being more specific as I sometimes struggle to put my thoughts into words.
          Another skill that I would like to develop would be my ability to work within pairs. 
          I'm new to pair programming and I don't have much of an idea of how I will conduct myself when pairing but I'm willing to put in the effort to learn and improve.
        </p>

        <h2>My expectations from the Bootcamp team</h2>
        <p>
          From the Bootcamp team I expect a certain manner of respect which I think can be built from being positive and approachable. 
          I hope to receive effective feedback on my progression and to receive support when needed. I also think encouragement is important because participation is what raises engagement and therefore improves the overall learning experience.
        </p>

        <h2>My expectations of myself at Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          I expect myself to be respectful to others that are around me and to be polite when talking. 
          I aim to be fully engaged with the course by following rules, being on time, being prepared, and completing objectives on time. 
        </p>

        <h2>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p>
          When I find myself struggling to find answers to any problems that may come up, I will seek help from either the human skills facilitators for support or the technical facilitators when there are any technical concerns. 
          I could also ask my peers for assistance if I ever find myself falling behind.
        </p>

      <h2>My long-term goal and career pathway</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal would be to become proficient using the technologies and software skills that I learn at Dev Academy. 
        An Ideal career pathway for me would be to start with an internship and then to secure a permanent full-time position within web development.
      </p>

      <h2>My strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
      <p>
        I think my research skills are a valuable strength to have because this experience often requires a lot of self-learning. 
        I have some prior learning experience in software development so I think that contributes to my ability to do efficient research. 
        I have implemented the growth mindset which I think will help with my development in skills and talents as I like to challenge myself to learn more through hard work and dedication. 
        As for limitations I'd say poor time management would be one as sometimes I get so caught up in one thing and forget I should be spending time in 
        something else I should be doing. Another would be procrastination which usually happens when I have to do something I dislike. Luckily, 
        I have been enjoying myself so far but I plan to overcome this limitation.
      </p>

      <h2>Skills I would like to see developed while at Dev Academy</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to develop my communication skills as I want to become more effective at conveying my thoughts and ideas. 
        I hope to also improve my creativity, as I feel like I could definitely think more outside the box. I plan to improve on this by exploring multiple solutions of 
        creativity and doing experiments of my own.
      </p>

      <h2>How I will manage my workload in this programme</h2>

      <h3>How I will manage myself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</h3>
      <p>I will manage my productivity by setting goals each day as to what tasks I should complete and making sure I finish them before the end of the day. 
        Reflection is a big part of this programme I found that it helps to understand and gain insight in the learning material. 
        I will also do some reflection of my own so that I can remember the key concepts and to identify ways to improve. 
        I plan to improve my productivity by eliminating distractions such as not having my phone nearby and listening to brown noise when it gets a little noisy. I'm also using a separate account for this programme 
        so that I don't get tempted to slack off.
      </p>

      <h3>What I will do when things are building up and starting to get to me</h3>
      <p>
        If things are starting to get tough then the first thing I would do is to see if I can re-evaluate my goals for the day so that I can maybe work on something easier 
        before getting back to those more difficult goals. Breaking up the large tasks into smaller ones can also help with achieving the goals I set.  
        Taking a break is an important part of remaining productive to relieve stress and gather my thoughts. I notice that it can also lead to solutions as I find myself often coming up with ideas when 
        I'm lying in bed or when I'm in the middle of doing something else.
      </p>

      <h3>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>
        I usually look to online research when I'm stuck but if I cannot find the answer that I am looking for within a reasonable amount of time then 
        I will seek guidance from the facilitators or peers in the discord channel.
      </p>

      <h3>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
      <p>
        A positive learning environment is important for everyone taking part because it has an impact on our engagement which I think is crucial for our learning experience.
        The main thing I expect is a response within a timely manner to clarify any questions that may be asked and clear explanations on the learning material.
