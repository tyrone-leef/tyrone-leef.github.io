        <h2>1.	A situation where I have made an ethical decision</h2>
        <p>
          I had a friend who would fall behind on work every now and then so I was tempted to just let them copy from me. But I was also worried that we would get in trouble. 
          So instead, I decided to do the responsible thing and help them work through some of their problems which they were very appreciative.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2.	How my culture and the people around me have influenced my values and identity</h2>
        <p>
          I will admit I'm a bit of a lazy person but I feel as though my friends and family motivate me to do better. My parents are hard workers so I strive to become more productive with my time. 
          Seeing them be so busy is also why I am determined on securing a job that doesn't require me to work long hours every day as I want to at least have a bit of free time with my short life on this planet.
          I would like to think I have a decent sense of judgement I've been on the internet for a while and overtime I noticed it's very easy to see one side of an argument and be completely attuned to that side. 
          I like to look at both sides and come to my own conclusion as there are always two sides to every story.
        </p>
        
        <h2> 3.	My strengths and how they will support me during my learning journey</h2>
        <p>
          One strength I identify with is my determination and I think this could help my learning journey when it comes to problem solving as I will continuously try to find an answer to a problem no matter the number of setbacks or how frustrated I become.
          My enthusiasm to learn is another strength that I think will be a key motivator and a way to keep me positive for this experience. I was excited to get back into programming as I found joy in the problem-solving side to it.
          Respectfulness is something that I find to be very important when it comes to collaborating or team work. I tend to listen to others and accept their differences in opinions or decisions which I think shows a good sign of respect.
        </p>
        
        <h2>4.  My limitations in terms of learning and career development</h2>
        <p>
          I would say I am a quiet and reserved person I feel as though that it's not exactly a good thing when it comes to socialising. This may affect how I work in group settings and how I handle communicating with others.
          Lack of consistency is something that hinders my learning experience as procrastination can be a big issue because there are times when I would rather do anything than what I'm supposed to do. I think I excel when there are things I
          like to do however when it comes to things I find boring then thats where procrastination kicks in.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>5.	A moment when I was trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension</h2>
        <p>
          I had a disagreement with one of my team members a while ago during an assignment because they were not present when the lecturer specified that we had to do a specific part of our chosen topic as it was too big. 
          My team member wanted to do the topic as a whole and as I tried to explain to them the reasoning why we couldn't they just would not agree even after I told them that it was the lecturer who provided what must be done. 
          By the end we just called upon the lecturer to help explain the situation and all was resolved. 
          A strategy I would try now would be to make more compelling arguments I think it could help with trying to find a solution in a team manner.
          Planning ahead could also be a useful strategy as I can gather my thoughts before presenting them.
        </p>
