      <h2>Neuroplasticity Research</h2>
      <h3>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h3>
      <p>
        One must know that their brain has the ability to change and adapt which in turn will have many benefits to the way a person responds to certain situations. 
        Some benefits people can gain from understanding the principles of neuroplasticity include an increased ability to learn new things, enhanced existing cognitive capabilities, 
        and strengthened areas where function is lost or declined.
      </p>

      <h3>How I might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit.</h3>
      <p>
        I could engage with the principles of neuroplasticity by changing unwanted habits and developing good habits like consistent healthy eating, exercise, or meditation.
        Actively engaging in an activity repetitively will help me to get better at it and will build stronger connections in the brain. 
        One last thing would be to face more intense challenges as things that are easy will not provide much of a difference.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        You can increase your neuroplasticity through learning a new skill like learning a new language or instrument.
        Another method would be to exercise as physical activity is beneficial for multiple regions of your brain and has shown to have a positive impact on your memory and learning capabilities.
        Good sleep can improve your brain performance and well-being. A lack of sleep can inhibit your neuroplasticity as well as increase the risk of many diseases and disorders.

      <h2>Growth Mindset Research</h2>
      <h3>What is a Growth Mindset?</h3>
      <p>
        A Growth mindset is a way of thinking that allows a person to be more open to challenges rather than being intimidated by them and to persevere through setbacks. 
        This is relevant because having a growth mindset will garner many benefits to improving skills and approaching challenges.
      </p>

      <h3>What surprised me and what changed</h3>
      <p>
        Something that surprised me that I didn't really think about was how people who often strive to learn more seem to have more setbacks than others. 
        I think I have become a little more comfortable with approaching tougher challenges because when you think about it other people who also go through these challenges 
        often have the same thoughts and setbacks so it's not as intimidating once you know others go through the same experience.
      </p>
      
      <h3>How I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey</h3>
      <p>
        I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey by viewing my mistakes as a way to learn from them which will help me make better decisions in the future. 
        Viewing the success of others can help me get an idea of how they achieved their success and how I could incorporate some of their mindset qualities into my own. 
        One final way to integrate growth mindset would be to review my own improvements through reflection as it might be the encouragement that I need to further motivate myself to do even better.

      <h2>How these understandings blend with my learning plan and strategies</h2>
      <p>
        One of the principles of neuroplasticity is repetition and I think this is very crucial to my learning plan because to get better at coding requires a lot of repetition 
        which will help build my confidence and understanding of the subject. Another principle I think will have an influence is specificity which is to train the brain in a specific way. 
        Developing healthy habits like meditation and practicing mindfulness will help improve my mood and productivity. 
        As for growth mindset employing the understandings into my learning plan by challenging myself and continuing to work on my skills will be a great way to develop and achieve my goals.
