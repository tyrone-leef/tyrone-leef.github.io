      <h2>Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning</h2>
      <p>
        One thing that I learned about myself is that I tend to keep pushing things until later instead of completing them earlier for example this blog which I probably should've done a couple days ago. 
        I find that I work better under pressure which is why I push things till it's very late however that may or may not be a good thing. 
        Another thing I learned is that through the practice of meditation I find myself to be a lot calmer and I can focus a bit better, which has helped a lot with my study and ability to learn. 
        One more thing that I've learnt would be that my mental habits are often negative but I've come to learn that I should try to think more positively to defend against superego.
      </p>

      <h2>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming</h2>
      <p>
        Values are a vital part to our behaviour and beliefs and will have an important role to play as they are what helps us grow and develop. Values are reflected in our decision making and can help us find our purpose in life.
        Empathy is our ability to understand how another person feels and can give us incite to their thoughts.
        Having empathy in a learning and programming environment allows us to be more successful by increasing engagement, building better relationships, and being more cooperative.
        Self-awareness is what helps us make better decisions and gives us more self-confidence. 
        Self-awareness can help an individual identify their strengths and weaknesses better which will allow a person to concentrate their efforts in areas that require more practice and support.

      <h2>What surprised me the most about the core learning</h2>
      <p>
        What surprised me the most about core learning was finding out the benefits of mindfulness through the practice of meditation. 
        I never really practiced any type of meditation and now that I've learned how it can help, I've made it a habit to do each day.
      </p>

      <h2>The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h2>
      <p>
        The most challenging aspects of core learning for me was working on the research topics such as emotional intelligence or neuroplasticity. 
        I found that I invested the most time in researching, reading, and trying to properly understand the research topics so I could write about them in my blogs and apply them to my learning plan.
      </p>

      <h2>Why I think so much time is focused on core learning in a web development bootcamp course</h2>
      <p>
        I think the time spent focused on core learning is to prep students for job interviews and interacting with others in the realm of programming. 
        I think putting these teachings into practice is a fantastic way to strengthen soft skills and improve learning abilities.
      </p>

      <h2>Does the time spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h2>
      <p>
        I don't think the time I've spent studying core learning was a waste of time, but I think my lack of interest in core learning is probably not a good thing because I feel as if I could take away more if I did have more of an interest. 
        During this blog I went back to some of the core learning material to remind myself of the teachings, and I actually learned a couple new things which I probably would have picked up on earlier had I been paying more attention.
