      <h2>My long term goal</h2>
      <p>
        I hope to use the skills that I gain during this course to further increase my knowledge in web-development and to put those skills to use in the field of programming. 
        The impact that I would like to make once I leave Dev Academy is to be known as just someone who gets stuff done and can be relied on.
      </p>

      <h2>My biggest strengths and limitations in Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        One of my biggest strengths in Bootcamp will be my attention to detail. 
        Throughout foundations I noticed that I have gotten better at recognising errors in my code, remembering commands, and noticing patterns. 
        Another strength I have will be my patience and I think this will help when it comes to encountering tough challenges as finding solutions can require a bit of time and focus.
        In foundations I listed procrastination as one of my limitations, but I don't think procrastinating is an option at Bootcamp so I think my next biggest limitation would be my communication skills. 
        I need to improve on my communication skills because in order to become more cooperative I need to make an effort in communicating clearly with others.
      </p>

      <h2>My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        Speaking in front of groups is definitely one of the biggest challenges for me as I don't have much practice speaking to an audience. 
        I aim to bring a positive attitude and I will try to be aware of how I speak to others.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-technical skills I would like to see developed while at Dev Academy</h2>
      <p>
        A non-technical skill that I would like to see developed while at Dev Academy would be my ability to give feedback as sometimes, I just don't know how. I need to work on being more specific as I sometimes struggle to put my thoughts into words.
        Another skill that I would like to develop would be my ability to work within pairs. 
        I'm new to pair programming and I don't have much of an idea of how I will conduct myself when pairing but I'm willing to put in the effort to learn and improve.
      </p>

      <h2>My expectations from the Bootcamp team</h2>
      <p>
        From the Bootcamp team I expect a certain manner of respect which I think can be built from being positive and approachable. 
        I hope to receive effective feedback on my progression and to receive support when needed. I also think encouragement is important because participation is what raises engagement and therefore improves the overall learning experience.
      </p>

      <h2>My expectations of myself at Bootcamp</h2>
      <p>
        I expect myself to be respectful to others that are around me and to be polite when talking. 
        I aim to be fully engaged with the course by following rules, being on time, being prepared, and completing objectives on time. 
      </p>

      <h2>How and where I will seek help in a timely way</h2>
      <p>
        When I find myself struggling to find answers to any problems that may come up, I will seek help from either the human skills facilitators for support or the technical facilitators when there are any technical concerns. 
        I could also ask my peers for assistance if I ever find myself falling behind.
      </p>

      <h2>Three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the core learning</h2>
      <p>
        One thing that I learned about myself is that I tend to keep pushing things until later instead of completing them earlier for example this blog which I probably should've done a couple days ago. 
        I find that I work better under pressure which is why I push things till it's very late however that may or may not be a good thing. 
        Another thing I learned is that through the practice of meditation I find myself to be a lot calmer and I can focus a bit better, which has helped a lot with my study and ability to learn. 
        One more thing that I've learnt would be that my mental habits are often negative but I've come to learn that I should try to think more positively to defend against superego.
      </p>

      <h2>The role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming</h2>
      <p>
        Values are a vital part to our behaviour and beliefs and will have an important role to play as they are what helps us grow and develop. Values are reflected in our decision making and can help us find our purpose in life.
        Empathy is our ability to understand how another person feels and can give us incite to their thoughts.
        Having empathy in a learning and programming environment allows us to be more successful by increasing engagement, building better relationships, and being more cooperative.
        Self-awareness is what helps us make better decisions and gives us more self-confidence. 
        Self-awareness can help an individual identify their strengths and weaknesses better which will allow a person to concentrate their efforts in areas that require more practice and support.
      </p>

      <h2>What surprised me the most about the core learning</h2>
      <p>
        What surprised me the most about core learning was finding out the benefits of mindfulness through the practice of meditation. 
        I never really practiced any type of meditation and now that I've learned how it can help, I've made it a habit to do each day.
      </p>

      <h2>The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h2>
      <p>
        The most challenging aspects of core learning for me was working on the research topics such as emotional intelligence or neuroplasticity. 
        I found that I invested the most time in researching, reading, and trying to properly understand the research topics so I could write about them in my blogs and apply them to my learning plan.
        Why I think so much time is focused on core learning in a web development bootcamp course
        I think the time spent focused on core learning is to prep students for job interviews and interacting with others in the realm of programming. 
        I think putting these teachings into practice is a fantastic way to strengthen soft skills and improve learning abilities.
      </p>

      <h2>Does the time spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</h2>
      <p>
        I don't think the time I've spent studying core learning was a waste of time, but I think my lack of interest in core learning is probably not a good thing because I feel as if I could take away more if I did have more of an interest. 
        During this blog I went back to some of the core learning material to remind myself of the teachings, and I actually learned a couple new things which I probably would have picked up on earlier had I been paying more attention.
