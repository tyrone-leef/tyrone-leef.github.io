        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence, also known as emotional quotient (EQ), is the ability to understand and manage your emotions as well as recognise the emotions of others. 
        There are many signs of emotional intelligence, such as feelings of empathy towards other people, maintaining good relationships, clear communication, and control over impulsive feelings.</p>

        <h2>How is EQ different from IQ?</h2>
        <p>The intelligence quotient (IQ) is a score that is obtained from a set of tests and can assess the intelligence of a person.
        The emotional quotient (EQ) is usually measured by how one can respond to a certain situation and then by assessing their skills.
        EQ has mostly to do with your ability to understand the emotions of yourself and others, while IQ is more of a measurement of your reasoning and mental ability to solve problems.</p>

        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>Emotions have an impact on your behaviour and that of those around you, so it is important to be self-aware and 
        socially aware so that you have a handle on your own emotional thoughts and behaviours while also understanding the emotions, needs, and concerns of others. 
        Emotional intelligence can help you succeed in life by improving communication skills, building better relationships, making better decisions, achieving goals, and defusing conflict in a healthier manner. 
        Emotional intelligence can be learned and strengthened, so don't fret if this is something you need to work on because all it takes is some time and practice.</p><br><br>
