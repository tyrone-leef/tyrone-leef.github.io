      <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>

      <p>
        The margin, border, and padding have a significant role in how the space is controlled in web design.
        The space between the elements on a web page is essential for making a clean and organised design. It provides a better user experience and will surely enhance the overall aesthetic.
        Margin and padding share similarities but they are not the same, it is important to know the difference between the two and when to use them. 
        As for the border this property serves as a great way to contrast colour between a web element and the background of a web page.

      <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>
      <p>
        The CSS box model is used to create the design and layout of a web page. 
        It refers to the container that holds the properties of content, padding, border, and margin.

      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Padding is the space that is around the content area.</li>
        <li>The Border can be visible or invisible depending on how it is styled, it is between the padding and margin.</li>
        <li>The Margin is the space outside of the border or the space around an element.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h2>Margin and Padding</h2>
      <p>
        The margin can be seen as the whitespace around an element and it is unaffected by styling of other elements.
        Padding helps create distance between the content and the border but unlike the margin it can be affected by the styling of other elements.
        Margin and padding use the same measure of units which include px, %, em, rem, vw, and vh. There are of course more within CSS but these are the ones I found to be commonly used.<br>
        You can change the space of the margin or padding by providing a value.
        When only one value is given then the same value will be applied to all sides. 
        For 2 values the first will apply to the top and bottom and the second will be for left and right.
        When 3 values are given then the first will be the top, the second is the left and right, then the third will be the bottom.
        Up to four values can be given in a clockwise order from top, right, bottom, and then left.<br>
        Here is a snippet of what it would look like in CSS.

        <h2>Border</h3>
      <p>
        The border property can be styled in multiple ways that includes the colour and thickness of the border as well.<br>
        Here are some examples.
