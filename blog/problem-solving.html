      <h2>1. A moment when I was blocked on a simple problem.</h2>

      <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        I was working on a function that needed to return a modified string with each word starting with a capital letter, 
        I ran into an issue where the output would return a string with all capitals. 
        I later realised that I just needed to add a space between the split method quote marks.
      </p>

      <h3>What problem-solving techniques were used?</h3>
      <p>
        I used console.logging to find my error and Googling helped me realise my mistake.
      </p>
      
      <h3>How did I feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        I was frustrated because I knew that I was close to figuring it out but I was just missing something. 
        As soon as I found out what was wrong, I was relieved and happy.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
      <p>
        When I was working on this problem, I learned that all the letters were being split instead of each word so when the map method mapped over each letter 
        it would capitalize each one and then return the string with all capitals.
      </p>

      <h2>2. A moment when I elegantly solved a problem.</h2>

      <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        There is a function that I was working on where it would need to return an array with only even numbers.
      </p>

      <h3>What problem-solving techniques did I use?</h3>
      <p>
        I used Google to help find a method to get all the even numbers and what I found was the filter method. 
        I just tried writing code from the stuff that I remembered and what was shown to be used on Google and I actually managed to get it working on my first attempt.
      </p>

      <h3>How did I feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        I was surprised because when I ran the test, I thought this probably isn't going to work but at least it's a start and 
        I'll see what I can do to get the right answer but it passed and I was thrilled with the result.
      </p>

      <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
      <p>
        I learned about the filter method and how it can be used to filter elements from a given array.
      </p>

      <h2>3. How confident I feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes.</h2>

      <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        Pseudocode helps me get an idea of what to do and it can help break down a problem into smaller problems which will allows me to work my way through to get the right result. 
        Sometimes I feel as if I'm not on the right track with the pseudocode that I write but at least it is a good starting point for me to work from.
      </p>

      <h3>Trying something</h3>
      <p>
        More often than not I would always get an error when trying something but I felt like that was the whole point of it so I could try and fix what went wrong. 
        Sometimes I can get stuck trying something new over and over which leads me nowhere so I found that I use this technique better when combined with others.
      </p>

      <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
      <p>
        When I'm really stuck, I resort to the rubber ducky method as I need to fully understand what is going on with my code in order to find out the root of the problem. 
        I would say that this technique has been an effective way for me to slow down and make more accurate decisions. 
      </p>

      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
      <p>
        I am not a hundred percent confident with reading error messages and I definitely think that this is something I can work on. 
        I can somewhat understand some of the error messages but sometimes I'm not sure how to fix them. 
        Syntax errors are usually the easiest to understand but I could do with some more practice with understanding the others.
      </p>

      <h3>Console.logging</h3>
      <p>
        I think Console.logging is very useful as it is a way for me to see the output of my code and to make changes based off what the output was. 
        I use this frequently especially when there are multiple parts of the code that handles data.
      </p>

      <h3>Googling</h3>
      <p>
        I find Googling to be an essential part of problem-solving because I don't think I could have gotten anywhere without it. 
        I've also been told that even when you work as a programmer you will be using Google quite often. 
        This is usually my go to technique when there is something I do not understand or when I'm looking for something that could help me solve a problem. 
      </p>

      <h3>Asking peers for help</h3>
      <p>
        Asking for help from peers is a great way to establish positive social connections. When I work with someone else or a group, I find that asking for help
        can build trust and improve productivity when working towards a shared goal.
      </p>

      <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
      <p>
        Coaches or anyone in a similar position can be very helpful and clear when giving answers to questions. I myself don't often ask for help, but when I do I am always
        appreciative and I find that asking for help is always welcomed. 
      </p>

      <h3>Improving my process with reflection</h3>
      <p>
        Reflection is a great way for me to keep memory of the fundamentals and sometimes I may also learn something new from it. 
        With reflection I can break down the problems that I worked on and see all the details of what went wrong and how 
        I was able to find a solution which will help when something similar comes up in the future.
      </p>

      <h2>4. A time where I was reluctant to ask for help.</h2>
      <p>
        When I got stuck working on a for loop that adds a property to every element in an array, I was reluctant to ask for help because I really wanted to see if I could figure it out on my own.
        Although I probably spent a little too much time on this problem, I think it would have been better to reach out for help or a hint to find the answer more quickly.
